# Image Generation Models
This repository is aimed at exploring various deep learning architectures for image geneartion. The implementation is done in PyTorch. 

## Models:

1. DCGAN
2. WGAN with gradient penalty
3. ProGAN

### Prerequisites
While I tried to add resouces wherever neccessary and repelicate scripts to colab, some basic understanding in deep learning and various architectures will make it way easier to understand the scripts.
